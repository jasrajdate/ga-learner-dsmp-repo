### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better grip on the applications of regularization. In this project, I applied the following concepts:

Train-test split

Correlation between the features

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regressor

Lasso Regressor

Ridge Regressor

R^2 Evaluation Metrics
